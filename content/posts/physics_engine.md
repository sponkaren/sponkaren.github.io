As second year students at TGA we have the option of building our own game engine.<br/>
The game engine is developed and simultaneously used in a total of 4 game projects.<br/>
There is a requirement for a physics library from in the third project,<br/>but I reasoned that having a physics library integrated already in the first project.<br/>
The main reason being we could use it for as general collision system solution as well.<br/><br/>Here's how it went. 

### Project 1 - Make it work
