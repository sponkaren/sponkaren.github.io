| **Type:**     |Personal Specialization Project at The Game Assembly|
| **Engine:**   |Occam â€“ My own Graphics Engine built as part of the education at The Game Assembly|
| **Intent:**   |I wanted to learn more about optimization through Compute Shaders and sorting algorithms. I also wanted to see what gameplay ides would emerge if time would   allow for any such implementation.|
